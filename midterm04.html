                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    <h3>Saturday Ticket System</h3>  
                    <p>We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room, beginning at 8 am on the Saturday of the sale. If you receive a ticket, 
                        the number on it reserves your corresponding place in the line, allowing you to go off and get coffee or to visit the Children's and 
                        Bargain Book rooms. Please be sure to return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your spot in the line: if you 
                        miss the time when your number is allowed to enter the Main Room you will forfeit your place in line. If you do not arrive in time 
                        to get a ticket, please just join the latter part of the line. Because of our severe space limitations and compelling issues of health and safety, 
                        we will only allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time. On Saturdays, customers will be originally admitted in the order of their numbered 
                        tickets that are given out from 8 to 11 am.</p>
                        <p>Once inside, customers may take only 12 books off of shelves, after which they should purchase these and exit via the east door. They may then 
                        join at the end of any remaining line at the north door and reenter in that order. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line remains outside.</p>
                    <h3>Pets</h3>
                    <p>Pets are welcome to walk throughout our outside areas, but please refrain from bringing them inside the book sale spaces. We have many items near 
                        the floor and would hate for you to be responsible for items you do not want to pay for.</p>
                    <h3>Food and Beverages</h3>
                    <p>Food and beverages are allowed outside our book selling spaces. Please refrain from bringing edible items into the book sale spaces. On Sundays, food 
                        trucks line up along the north driveway. Please enjoy these treats at the picnic tables or benches outside. </p>
                    <p><strong>No haggling allowed. No bulk-buying outside of what FOPAL allows within its policies.</strong></p> 
                    <p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
