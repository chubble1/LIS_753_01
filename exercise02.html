            <p>My name is Claire Hubble. Above is a photo of the Hubble Telescope and one time when I was younger my paternal grandma did say we were related to Edwin Hubble, inventor of said telescope. She was very old when she told me and I haven't done due deligence in researching if it's true, so who knows. </p>
            <p>I like that sometimes I'll say for spelling purposes, <q>Hubble, like the telescope,</q> and the person I'm talking to will have absolutely no idea that there even is a telescope called Hubble. Always fun to stay humble. (Or is it stay Hubble?)</p>
