                <h2>My name is Claire Hubble.</h2>
                <p>Below is a photo of the Hubble Telescope and one time when I was younger my paternal grandma did say we were related to Edwin Hubble, inventor of said telescope. 
                    She was very old when she told me and I haven't done due deligence in researching if it's true, so who knows. </p>

                <p>I like that sometimes I'll say for spelling purposes, <q>Hubble, like the telescope,</q> and the person I'm talking to will have absolutely no idea that there even is a telescope called Hubble. 
                    Always fun to stay humble. I really like my name. The consonants feel good on my cheeks and lips--a stark difference from the feeling my mouth gets when I say my own first name out loud. 
                    No, saying the name <q>Hubble</q> is always a great time. </p>

                <p>Ever since I was little, I was surprised that when people get married, one partner loses the name they've had since birth. Even though I was a child, I was put off by the fact that it was always the woman, 
                    or more feminine partner, to give their connection to their past away. I still think it's really strange. That's my name! Don't take it. My mother uses her maiden name as her middle name, as most Gen Xers 
                    and older do, but even that hurts: where does my middle name go?</p>
                <p>I've been with my boyfriend for five whole years now, and every day I think about getting married a little bit more. (All of my friends are getting married, plus our moms ask us every single time we see 
                    them if we're getting married soon.) I told him very early on I planned on keeping my own last name no matter who I marry, and sometimes I worry if this hurts his feelings at all. He says he doesn't mind--
                    he actually despises most wedding and marriage traditions as much as I do. Although he supports me to keep the Hubble name, I worry about what his dad, his grandpa, our hypothetical children might 
                    think about my decision. Will they too want to feel connected to their past through their name? Will I be the one who breaks this connection?</p>

                <p>My decision is bound to societal ideals that I want to be a good wife, a good daughter, a good mother, and a good feminist. No matter what I ultimately decide to do with my last name, I'll fail at one of these. 
                    Odd how things like names connect us to each other, and to history and science, and in some cases, to the actual stars.
