<h1>What's In a Name?</h1>
<p>My name is Claire Hubble. Below is a photo of the Hubble Telescope and one time when I was younger my paternal grandma did say we were related to Edwin Hubble, inventor of said telescope. She was very old when she told me and I haven't done due deligence in researching if it's true, so who knows. </p>

<p> I like that sometimes I'll say for spelling purposes, "Hubble, like the telescope," and the person I'm talking to will have absolutely no idea that there even is a telescope called Hubble. Always fun to stay humble. (Or is it stay Hubble?) Either way, I feel good having this name. I think I want to keep it forever, which rubs some people the wrong way. Ever since I was a small child I thought it was weird that when two people get married, only one of the two gets to keep the name they have had forever. (And even as a child I was upset that the person who usually does this is the woman or more feminine partner.)</p>

(All of my friends are getting married, plus our moms ask us every single time we see them if we're getting married soon.) I told him very early on I planned on keeping my own last name no matter who I marry, and sometimes I worry if this hurts his feelings at all. He says he doesn't mind--he actually despises most wedding and marriage traditions as much as I do. Although he supports me to keep the Hubble name, I worry about what his dad, his grandpa, our hypothetical children might think about my decision. </p>
<p> My decision is bound to societal ideals that I want to be a) a good wife, b) a good daughter, and c) a good feminist. No matter what I ultimately decide to do with my last name, I'll fail at one of these. This is just one of the paradoxes women face today.
