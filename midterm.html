                <p> Visit us at our monthly Friends of Palo Alto Library Book Sale! We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more. These are mostly donations from individuals, 
                    estates, and companies. We also sell items that the Palo Alto Library has removed from their shelves to make room for new purchases. You'll find these same low prices on all the other tens 
                    of thousands of books that we have.
