                <p>We have over 50,000 wonderful used books, records, videos, magazines, and more. These are mostly donations from individuals, 
                    estates, and companies. We also sell items that the Palo Alto Library has removed from their shelves to make room for new purchases. </p>
                <p>You'll find these same low prices on all the other tens of thousands of books that we have. While some booksellers may pledge a portion of your purchase to help local libraries, we give 100%. Plus, we charge no sales tax and we have the 
                    friendliest sales people you will ever find. You can now also purchase gift certificates at the sale in $5 denominations.</p>
                <p> Although we have sales shelves in most Palo Alto Library locations, our most popular (and biggest!) book sales occur the second weekend of each month all day Saturday and Sunday.</p>
                <p>The next book sale is scheduled for <strong>November 11th and 12th, 2023.</strong></p>
                <h2>About Friends of Palo Alto Library</h2>
                <p> FOPAL is a foundation dedicated to supprting the Palo Alto Library and the Palo Alto community. Throughout the year we host fundraisers of all kinds--our monthly book sales being most popular--to raise money that 
                    specifically goes to the Palo Alto Library to purchase new books, support all kinds of programming, and to benefit the community as a whole.
                </p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <p><strong>No haggling allowed. No bulk-buying outside of what FOPAL allows within its policies.</strong></p>
                <p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
                <h3>Saturday Ticket System</h3>  
                <p id="FAQ">We hand out a maximum of two numbered tickets per person at the Main Room, beginning at 8 am on the Saturday of the sale. If you receive a ticket, 
                    the number on it reserves your corresponding place in the line, allowing you to go off and get coffee or to visit the Children's and 
                    Bargain Book rooms. Please be sure to return to the Main Room a few minutes before it opens to reclaim your spot in the line: if you 
                    miss the time when your number is allowed to enter the Main Room you will forfeit your place in line. If you do not arrive in time 
                    to get a ticket, please just join the latter part of the line. Because of our severe space limitations and compelling issues of health and safety, 
                    we will only allow 160 customers into the Main Room at a time. On Saturdays, customers will be originally admitted in the order of their numbered 
                    tickets that are given out from 8 to 11 am.</p>
                <p>Once inside, customers may take only 12 books off of shelves, after which they should purchase these and exit via the east door. They may then 
                    join at the end of any remaining line at the north door and reenter in that order. The limitation of 12 books at a time will continue past noon if a line remains outside.</p>
                <h3>Pets</h3>
                <p>Pets are welcome to walk throughout our outside areas, but please refrain from bringing them inside the book sale spaces. We have many items near 
                    the floor and would hate for you to be responsible for items you do not want to pay for.</p>
                <h3>Food and Beverages</h3>
                <p>Food and beverages are allowed outside our book selling spaces. Please refrain from bringing edible items into the book sale spaces. On Sundays, food 
                    trucks line up along the north driveway. Please enjoy these treats at the picnic tables or benches outside. </p>
